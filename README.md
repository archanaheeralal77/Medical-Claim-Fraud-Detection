**Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Collection**
1.	Define Objectives
   
o	 Understand fraud detection in medical claims.

o	Identify key fraud indicators (e.g., excessive billing, duplicate claims).

o	Set performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

3.	Dataset Collection
   
o	Use your dataset

o	Ensure it contains relevant fields such as claim amount, hospital details, patient history, fraud labels.

o	Optionally, explore external datasets (e.g., Kaggle, government health records).
 
**Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & EDA**

3.	Data Cleaning

o	Handle missing values (fill, drop, or impute).

o	Convert categorical variables (e.g., policy type, hospital name) to numerical format.

o	Standardize text fields (e.g., diagnosis reports).


4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

o	Data Imbalance Check: Fraud vs. Non-Fraud cases.

o	Feature Correlation: Identify key variables influencing fraud.

o	Fraud Trend Analysis: Identify common fraud patterns.

o	Visualizations: 

	Pie chart: Fraud vs. Non-Fraud ratio.

	Histogram: Claim amount distribution.

	Box plot: Claim frequency per policyholder.
 
**Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Model Training**

5.	Feature Engineering

o	Statistical Features: 

	Claim frequency per patient.

	Deviation from average claim amount.

	Time gap between successive claims.


o	Text Processing (NLP): 

	Convert medical reports into structured features (TF-IDF or Word2Vec).

o	Anomaly Detection Features: 

	Flagging unusually high claim amounts.

	Identifying suspicious patterns (e.g., frequent hospital changes).

6.	Split Data into Train/Test Sets

o	Use an 80-20 or 70-30 split.

o	Stratified sampling if the fraud cases are imbalanced.
 
**Phase 4: Model Training & Evaluation**

7.	Train ML Models

o	Baseline Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

o	Advanced Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.

o	Deep Learning (Optional): Neural networks if needed.

8.	Model Evaluation

o	Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

o	Handle class imbalance using SMOTE or weighted loss functions.
 
**Phase 5: Deployment & Reporting**

9.	Deploy the Model

o	Using FAST API to expose predictions.

To Run Your FastAPI Server

1.	Install FastAPI & Uvicorn 
    a.	pip install fastapi uvicorn

2.	Save the above code as main.py

3.	Run the server
  a.	uvicorn main:app –reload

4.	Test it
  a.	Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
  b.	You’ll see the Swagger UI to test your /predict endpoint.


10.	Documentation & Report

•	Prepare a structured report covering objectives, methodology, results, and future scope.

•	Present findings with visualizations and explain feature importance.
